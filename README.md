INTRODUCTION --

This project is designed to facilitate a gymming and fitness center to automate its operations of keeping records and store them in form of a large and user friendly database further facilitating easy access to the personnel.


OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
	
What was the Problem?

Existing system was manual.

Time consuming as data entry which include calculations took lot of time.

Searching was very complex as there could be 100’s of entry every year.

The proposed system is expected to be faster than the existing system.

The Project was made in order to effectively and efficiently cater to requirements of  the fitness center.Very frequently the person who generally holds the tasks to manage the center needs to keep records of all the transactions as well as  data   mannually . Gennerally, In order to structure these tasks Separate Registers are maintained.This whole process thus becomes quite cumbersome for them to control manually.Moreover,Any wrong data entered mistakenly can brings serious results.

This Mannually Managed  system of the store was also heavily proned to data loss due to certain causes Misplacement of Registers,Destruction of Registers ,Unauthorized access to registers etc. which can bring in disasterous Consquences. 

The cost of maintaince of data and records of occurrence of transactions is very high.

Searching a particular data specific to particular requirements is also very tedious in such system.In order to retrieve records,The responsible person needs to manually locate the appropriate register and locate the appropriate placement of that particular record which may be very time consuming.

Data Redundency is also a great issue in such kind of system.”Redundency” means repititon;Thus data modified or updated at a  particular place may not be data modified or updated at the other related place which may create inconsistencies in data handling,Destroys Data Integrity and creates confusion for the owner.
What the Software Provides in this Regard?
The software is capable enough to allow the concerned person to store and retrieve any type of record  with just a single click of mouse.The software allows Interactive ,Self decribing Graphic User Interface environment where even standalone users can work very comfortably and easily.

All the data pertaining to transactions or other important entities is kept at central database from where its attributes can be easily controlled.But,Such kind of technical details are hidden from the standalone User. He just needs to type in correct details of the given entity and then click the save button with the help of mouse.However,That central repository of data can be easily accessed if required.

Data Redundency is no more the problem now.The data modified from one particular data entry form will reflect the modifications at the other related forms too.This has thus reduced the chances of data inconsistency in our data storage.

There is no need to manage bulky registers now as data stored in the backend database can be radily retrieved either from the frontend form itself or directly from the database.

Requires one time investment of setting up required Hardware and Software after which no more headache is required by the Managers.Moreover,It also reduces dependence on Man Power.

Effective Search measures are present at each and every data transactional forms from where by just entering a Unique keyword for that data its whole records can be readily seen within microseconds.Moreover,Facillity of Updation and Deletion of data through search is also available.
